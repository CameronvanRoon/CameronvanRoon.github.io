									<h2>What is your interest in I.T?</h2>
									<p>Like many in the field, my early interest in I.T. was fostered through a love for videogames. From the consoles to the mobile devices to personal computers, my enjoyment necessitated a certain level of tech savviness. However, as I grew older that interest was pushed on through sheer curiosity. As something of a futurist, there’s a certain delight that comes from experiencing a piece of gadgetry functioning as it was intended, particularly something that you designed. My interest was enhanced further still through my creative nature and the ability to engineer a piece of software to do something specific, even something as simple as manipulating values on an excel spreadsheet.</p>

									<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
									<p>I previously attended RMIT in order to complete my degree in creative writing after reading online recommendations for the course. I enjoyed the people, staff and students. I appreciated the central city location and felt like it offered a unique experience. When looking to study IT, RMIT seemed a logical decision. It’s even in the name. </p>

											My ideal job is one in which I can work in a small team where each member knows the others well and has a clearly defined role over which they have relative freedom. 
											</a><br />It offers the opportunity to tackle interesting unique problems using creativity, lateral thinking and conventional problem solving.
											</a><br />It involves project-oriented work that allows me to fit my work hours to the needs of the project. It would involve intensive hours during some months and a reduced work load during others.
											</a><br />It offers the option of working at home when appropriate but has a Melbourne city-based office for collaboration and meetings with the rest of the team.
											</a><br />The bulk of my role would be centred around software engineering, but with opportunities to complete other tasks based on the project, with the occasional opportunity for me to flex my writing muscles. 
											</a><br />The pay is sufficient to live without pressing monetary concerns.
											</a><br />This advertisement is for a Software Engineering position, specifically for polyglot programming, utilising a variety of programming languages. 
											</a><br />It contains many of the features I associate with my ideal job, such as a respectable salary, working on a small team, a focus on software engineering and the opportunity to work creatively to solve the problems that I encounter.

									<h3>Job Requirements</h3>
										<p>The job requires a bachelor’s degree or higher in computer science or similar. It requires a familiarity with Java, Ruby, Python and Go. It would like someone experienced with cloud architecture and test automation. It lists that it would like someone with a disposition toward continual learning.
										<br />By comparison, I am currently undertaking a course in computer science, am learning the Java programming language in the main thrust of the course, while also learning a little bit of Python. I don’t currently have much experience with cloud architecture or test automation but will be learning about cloud infrastructure as part of the course and will happily investigate test automation either through the course or outside of it. I absolutely have a disposition towards continual learning. I also have a lot of experience working as part of team, through my experience working in large-scale retail environment and as part of an elite sports team in a number of capacities. I also have extensive experience working in a private and self-motivated environment through my years as a novelist.</p>
										<h3>My Plan</h3>
										<p>Over the course of the next few years, I shall finish my degree in computer science, through which (and outside of which, through private reading and personal programming projects), I will expand my familiarity with the java programming language and others, such as Python. I will study cloud architecture in my course and test automation wherever possible. Once graduated, I will seek out any paid or unpaid employment to give me more experience in the above fields in order to facilitate further development of my knowledge and skills and continue my own private study and experimentation.</p>

									<h3>Myers-Briggs Test: Architect</h3>
									<p>My results in the Myers-Briggs personality test indicate that I am an INTJ-A. This means I am more introverted than extroverted. I favour intuition and the theoretical over observation and pragmaticism. I value thinking and logic over feelings, both other people's and my own. I prefer judging things with foresight and organisation over prospecting and flexibility. Finally, I am more assertive than turbulent, meaning I am generally confident in myself.

									<h3>Summary</h3>
									<p>In summary, these tests show that I am a creative individual who spends a lot of time theorising unique methods to solve new or existing problems. I don't like to blindly follow rules without understanding the reason behind them. I like to set clear goals to work towards and favour logic over an emotional response. 
										<br />I am also a visually oriented person.
										<br />Of course, all this is very generally speaking and a matter of leaning one way rather than another, but not to the complete exclusion of the other, so should absolutely be taken with a hearty handful of salt.
										<br />In a team environment, these results may indicate that I will pair best with other organized, visual and goal oriented people. They also indicate that I may be someone who leans towards taking a leadership role and need to be aware if this is a role that the other members of the team would like to see filled, or if I need to adjust my instinctual behavior to defer more to a team.

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<p>My idea for a project is a Facebook app that functions as a multiplayer AR videogame. The app makes posts such as fake news stories and fictional profile posts and fictional posts by the users to the players’ Facebook feeds in order to create a fictional work and allows interactions between players and the fabricated world and between each other. 
							<br />Each of the players is given their own specific goals, roles and abilities. There would be an apparent universal goal involving a fabricated real-world event (likely a supernatural phenomenon such as a zombie outbreak, alien invasion, or other supernatural creatures on the loose). However, most players also have their own individual goals, which may come into conflict with one another. It would require subterfuge and the ability to solve mysteries.
							</p>
							<h3> Motivation</h3>
								<p>There are 2.32 Billion active Facebook users world wide. People spend hours upon hours each week looking at their feeds, which are generally filled with mindless memes and uninteresting content. My idea is to spice up users’ social media experience by creating an engaging and fun fictional world they can interact with while they browse. It’s a fun game that can help bring friends together and enrich their experience together whether they’re neighbours or oceans apart by bringing the joys of games like Mafia or Werewolves to them with little effort. 
								</p>
							<h3> Description</h3>
								<p>Players would sign up to the app which would then need to create or join an instance of the game. The host could manage who is involved in the instance and what type/duration of the game the party would be engaging in. Once the party has been designated, the app begins to make targeted Facebook posts to the players. Both through these posts and/or through options within the app interface, the players would be granted a number of daily actions as determined by the events in the game and their roles/abilities. 
									<br />Effectively, the project creates a session of a game similar to Mafia or Werewolves that blends almost seamlessly into their social media platforms and allows for a fun new way to interact with its content. It allows for a group of players to interact with the game as much or as little as they like and potentially over a longer period of time.
									<br />Major events in the story (as conveyed through Facebook posts) would be shaped by the actions of the players as they try to avoid communal catastrophe and/or accomplish their own goals.
									<br />The game could also fake posts from the players themselves, including life events such as employment changes or even death (only visible to the other players, who have opted into the session and marked as being part of the game).
									<br />Sessions could take place over any of several different timeframes, from a more conventional single-night session over a few hours to a week or a month, or potentially even longer, which would be a unique and driving feature of the game.
									<br />Players would be able to utilize Facebook’s own in-built messenger functions to discuss aspects of the game. The idea is that the interactions of the game could spill over into the other social media interactions of the players.

							<h3> Features </h3>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Game Settings</h3>
									<p>Players can determine the number of participants, the game duration, and eventually even different themes, such as vampires, witches, mafia, aliens, Cthulhu,  etc. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Player Roles</h3>
									<p>Players are assigned unique roles with different goals and abilities, such as citizen, alien body-snatcher, sheriff, reporter, psychic, cult fanatic, doctor, scientist, FBI/Illuminati agent, or town mayor.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Non-Player Characters</h3>
									<p>Each with limited interaction means, but who are important for story events.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-diamond"></span>
									<h3>Major Events</h3>
									<p>Players will learn about and interact with major story events, such as a nearby UFO sighting (by a player or third-party), a UFO crash, an alien abduction or the discovery of a secret Area-51-esque complex. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-chain"></span>
									<h3>Contextual Event Interactions</h3>
									<p>Players are given the opportunity to respond to major events in ways such as going to a location to investigate, interviewing witnesses, researching the history of the area or ignoring it. Contextual interaction could also include role-specific actions like trying to intimidate witnesses, posting contradictory or fake reports or attempting to destroy evidence.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Daily/Weekly Actions</h3>
									<p>Players also have the option of using daily or weekly actions. These could include calling a community trial to determine whether an individual is secretly an alien body-snatcher. They could also use daily or weekly abilities unique to their role, such as a sheriff or reporter investigating, a body-snatched player attempting to take control of a player or NPC.</p>
								</section>
							</div>
							<h3> Tools and Technology</h3>
								<p>The simplicity of the idea means it could mostly be accomplished through the use of Facebook’s built-in app development tools (as available through https://developers.facebook.com/). The app may also require some extra basic programming. Depending on the way it is approached, one of the more challenging aspects of the process would be in the creation of art assets. This could be achieved through a variety of technologies, such as Adobe Photoshop and Final Cut Pro or Lightworks.
								</p>
							<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>The project will require a high amount of familiarity with the Facebook app development tools. It will also require some basic programming understanding, likely using java, and an ability to create or ascertain the art assets necessary to help bring the user an immersive experience. The development of art assets could require an intermediate to advanced understanding of software such as adobe photoshop, and potentially video editing software such as Final Cut Pro or Lightworks, if video is to be used.
								</p>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>If this task is completed, there will be a new, unique and fun game for people to play on Facebook. It will spice up users’ social media experiences and bring players closer together. It will be a solid foundation for expansion and refinement of the games core mechanics. Developing this game will also give the developers useful experience in app development, social media integration, creating user interfaces, and game development skills. It will also give us experience developing software in a team and the opportunity to interact with an ongoing development cycle.
