									<h2>What is your interest in I.T?</h2>
									<p>Like many in the field, my early interest in I.T. was fostered through a love for videogames. From the consoles to the mobile devices to personal computers, my enjoyment necessitated a certain level of tech savviness. However, as I grew older that interest was pushed on through sheer curiosity. As something of a futurist, there’s a certain delight that comes from experiencing a piece of gadgetry functioning as it was intended, particularly something that you designed. My interest was enhanced further still through my creative nature and the ability to engineer a piece of software to do something specific, even something as simple as manipulating values on an excel spreadsheet.</p>

										<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>
										<p> <span class="image left"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38551846?searchrequesttoken=cc8b954f-4324-4715-b381-32953f9e915f&type=standard" class="image"><img src="images/Ideal_Job.jpg" alt="" /></a></span>
											My ideal job is one in which I can work in a small team where each member knows the others well and has a clearly defined role over which they have relative freedom. 
											</a><br />It offers the opportunity to tackle interesting unique problems using creativity, lateral thinking and conventional problem solving.
											</a><br />It involves project-oriented work that allows me to fit my work hours to the needs of the project. It would involve intensive hours during some months and a reduced work load during others.
											</a><br />It offers the option of working at home when appropriate but has a Melbourne city-based office for collaboration and meetings with the rest of the team.
											</a><br />The bulk of my role would be centred around software engineering, but with opportunities to complete other tasks based on the project, with the occasional opportunity for me to flex my writing muscles. 
											</a><br />The pay is sufficient to live without pressing monetary concerns.
											</a><br />This advertisement is for a Software Engineering position, specifically for polyglot programming, utilising a variety of programming languages. 
											</a><br />It contains many of the features I associate with my ideal job, such as a respectable salary, working on a small team, a focus on software engineering and the opportunity to work creatively to solve the problems that I encounter.

									<h3>Job Requirements</h3>
										<p>The job requires a bachelor’s degree or higher in computer science or similar. It requires a familiarity with Java, Ruby, Python and Go. It would like someone experienced with cloud architecture and test automation. It lists that it would like someone with a disposition toward continual learning.
										<br />By comparison, I am currently undertaking a course in computer science, am learning the Java programming language in the main thrust of the course, while also learning a little bit of Python. I don’t currently have much experience with cloud architecture or test automation but will be learning about cloud infrastructure as part of the course and will happily investigate test automation either through the course or outside of it. I absolutely have a disposition towards continual learning. I also have a lot of experience working as part of team, through my experience working in large-scale retail environment and as part of an elite sports team in a number of capacities. I also have extensive experience working in a private and self-motivated environment through my years as a novelist.</p>
										<h3>My Plan</h3>
										<p>Over the course of the next few years, I shall finish my degree in computer science, through which (and outside of which, through private reading and personal programming projects), I will expand my familiarity with the java programming language and others, such as Python. I will study cloud architecture in my course and test automation wherever possible. Once graduated, I will seek out any paid or unpaid employment to give me more experience in the above fields in order to facilitate further development of my knowledge and skills and continue my own private study and experimentation.</p>

									<h3>Myers-Briggs Test: Architect</h3>
									<p>My results in the Myers-Briggs personality test indicate that I am an INTJ-A. This means I am more introverted than extroverted. I favour intuition and the theoretical over observation and pragmaticism. I value thinking and logic over feelings, both other people's and my own. I prefer judging things with foresight and organisation over prospecting and flexibility. Finally, I am more assertive than turbulent, meaning I am generally confident in myself.
									<br />In summary, the INTJ-A personality type means I am a highly creative individual who spends a lot of time theorising unique methods to solve new or existing problems. I don't like to blindly follow rules without understanding the reason behind them and like to set clear goals to work towards. Of course, all this is very generally speaking and a matter of leaning one way rather than another, but not to the complete exclusion of the other, so should absolutely be taken with a hearty handful of salt.</p>
